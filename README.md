About:-

This repository contains my Python practice programs, developed to strengthen core programming concepts, improve logical thinking,
and build problem-solving skills. The code reflects consistent practice and progressive learning, ranging from fundamentals to intermediate-level problems.
This repository is intended as a learning log as well as a reference for common Python patterns and techniques.

What This Repository Covers:-

1.Python Fundamentals (syntax, variables, data types)

2.Control Flow (if, elif, else)

3.Loops (for, while)

4.Functions and Modular Programming

5.Recursion

6.Data Structures
  
  6.1.Lists
 
  6.2.Tuples
  
  6.3.Sets
  
  6.4.Dictionaries

7.String Processing and Pattern Problems

8.Mathematical and Logical Problems

9.Basic File Handling

10.Exception Handling

11.Introductory Algorithmic Thinking

Objectives:-

Build a strong foundation in Python programming.
Develop clean and readable coding habits.
Practice logic-based and problem-solving questions.
Prepare for competitive exams, interviews, and academic assessments.
Maintain a structured record of continuous learning
