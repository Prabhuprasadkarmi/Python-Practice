# While Loop
    # In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
    # When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
cnt = 0
while (cnt < 3):
    cnt = cnt + 1
    print("Hello Prabhuprasad")

# Infinite While Loop
    # If we want a block of code to execute infinite number of times then we can use the while loop in Python to do so.
while (False):
    print("Hello Geeks")
