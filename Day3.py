# What is Python Operator

# operator are used in the operation on the variables

# operator = special symbol like + ,- , *, /,% etc.
# operand = on which the operator are used 

# Types of operators

# 1. Arithematic operator
   # Basic mathematical operation like addition,subtraction,multiplication,division

# Variables
a = 15
b = 3

# Addition
print("Addition:", a + b)  

# Subtraction
print("Subtraction:", a - b) 

# Multiplication
print("Multiplication:", a * b)  

# Division
print("Division:", a / b) 

# Floor Division
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # its give the only integer value of the division

# Modulus
print("Modulus:", a % b) # its give the remainder of the division

# Exponentiation
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b) # it multiple a into b times

print(a*a*a)

# comparision operator
    # comparing the variable and returns the true and false

a = 13
b = 33

print(a > b)    # is a greater than b
print(a < b)    # is a lesser than b
print(a == b)   # is a equal to b where = sign give the error
print(a != b)   # is a not equal to b
print(a >= b)   # is a greater than equal to b
print(a <= b)   # is a less than equal to b


# Logical operator
    # perform the logical and ,logical or ,logical not. And check the conditional statement 
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)
print(a or b)
print(not a)
